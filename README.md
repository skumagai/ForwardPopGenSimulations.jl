# ForwardPopGenSimulations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skumagai/ForwardPopGenSimulations.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skumagai/ForwardPopGenSimulations.jl)

ForwardPopGenSimulations.jl facilitates a rapid development of
forward-in-time population genetics simulations.
This software is inspired by [simuPOP][],
a Python framework for forward simulations,
and [fwdpp][], a C++ library for forward simulations.

The design goal of this simulator is the ease of rapid development for
a wide range of population and demographic models rather than seeking
small memory footprint or fast execution.
