# ForwardPopGenSims

ForwardPopGenSims provides basic functioinality to construct forward-in-time population genetics simulations.
Notable characteristics of this simulator include:
- constructing gene trees of extant populations as simulations moving forward,
- terminating simulations upon k-th complete turnover,
- agonistic to mutation, selection, and demographic models.
